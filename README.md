Welcome to FitTrack AI, a smart fitness app designed to make your workouts easier and more effective.

Our app uses your phone's sensors to automatically count your **sit-ups** and **jumps**, so you can focus on your form instead of counting. After each workout, you get a summary of your performance and receive personalized feedback generated by AI to help you improve.
